    "1. An effective ERM program should be a regular process, not a one-time event.\n",
    "2. Risks should be considered on an enterprise basis. (i.e. not just insurance risk)\n",
    "3. Focus on risks that have significant impact to the value of a firm.\n",
    "4. Risks must be quantified as best as possible. The impact of each risk should be calculated on an overall, portfolio basis and correlations with other risks should be considered.\n",
    "5. Strategies must be implemented to avoid, mitigate or exploit risks.\n",
    "6. Risk management strategies are evaluated for trade-off between risk and return."
