    "        - Claim appears in reinsurer's claim system\n",
    "    - Claim adjusters tend to reserve at modal value. Takes longer for the claim to breach the reinsurance threshold.\n",
    "    - Mass tort claims (i.e. asbestosis- related injuries) may have extreme delays in discovery or in reporting to the cedant."
